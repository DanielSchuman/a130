## **Appendix II to OMB Circular No. A-130**

**Guidance on Electronic Transactions and Open Data**

### **Summary**

The Office of Management and Budget (OMB) provides procedures and guidance to implement the Government Paperwork Elimination Act (GPEA),  and the Electronic Signatures in Global and National Commerce Act (E-SIGN), and evaluate open data practices.

GPEA requires Federal agencies to allow individuals or entities that deal with the agencies the option to submit information or transact with the agency electronically, when practicable, and for agencies to maintain records electronically, when practicable. GPEA specifically states that electronic records and their related electronic signatures are not to be denied legal effect, validity, or enforceability merely because they are in electronic form, and encourages Federal Government use of a range of electronic signature alternatives.

E-SIGN promotes the use of electronic contract formation, signatures, and recordkeeping in private commerce by establishing legal equivalence between: contracts written on paper and contracts in electronic form; pen-and-ink signatures and electronic signatures; and other legally required written documents (termed "records") and the same information in electronic form.

E-SIGN applies broadly to commercial, consumer, and business transactions affecting interstate or foreign commerce, and to transactions regulated by both Federal and State Government.

In support of GPEA and E-SIGN, the General Services Administration and the National Institute of Standards and Technology, in coordination with the Federal CIO Council, maintains guidance on use of Electronic Signatures (E-Signatures) in Federal organization transactions. This guidance expands upon OMB guidance.

This guidance also addresses agency best practices on open data.


### **Background**

This document provides agencies the guidance required under sections 1703 and 1705 of the Government Paperwork Elimination Act (GPEA), Public L. 105-277, Title XVII, signed into law on October 21, 1998, and the Electronic Signatures in Global and National Commerce Act (E-SIGN), Public L. 106-229, signed into law on June 30, 2000. GPEA and E-SIGN are important tools to improve customer service and governmental efficiency through the use of information technology.

As public awareness of electronic communications and Internet usage has increased, demand for on-line interactions with the Federal agencies has also increased. Moving to electronic transactions and electronic signatures can reduce transaction costs for the agency and its partners. Transactions are quicker and information access can be more easily tailored to the specific questions that need to be answered. As a result, data analysis by Federal agencies would be easier. In addition, reengineering the work process associated with transactions may improve efficiency of agency operations.

Public confidence in the security of the government's electronic information processes is essential as agencies make this transition. Electronic commerce, electronic mail, and electronic benefits transfer can require the exchange of sensitive information within government, between the government and private industry or individuals, and among governments. Electronic systems must be able to protect the confidentiality and privacy of information, authenticate the identity of the transacting parties to the degree required by the transaction, guarantee that the information is not altered in an unauthorized way, and provide access when needed. A corresponding policy and management structure must support the infrastructure that delivers these services.

GPEA seeks to "preclude agencies or courts from systematically treating electronic documents and signatures less favorably than their paper counterparts," so that citizens can interact with the Federal Government electronically (S. Rep. 105-335). It required Federal agencies to provide individuals or entities that deal with agencies the option to submit information or transact with the agency electronically, and to maintain records electronically, when practicable. It also addresses the matter of private employers being able to use electronic means to store, and file with Federal agencies, information pertaining to their employees. GPEA states that electronic records and their related electronic signatures are not to be denied legal effect, validity, or enforceability merely because they are in electronic form. It also encourages Federal Government use of a range of electronic signature alternatives. This guidance implements GPEA and supports the continued transition to electronic government.

E-SIGN also eliminates barriers to electronic commerce, while also providing consumers with protections equivalent to those available in the world of paper-based transactions. The Act makes clear that no person is required to use electronic records, signatures, or contracts. E-SIGN requires that a consumer affirmatively consent to the use of electronic notices and records. Prior to consenting, the consumer must receive notice of their rights. Moreover, the consumer must provide the affirmative consent electronically, in a manner that reasonably demonstrates that the consumer can access the electronic records that are the subject of the consent.

E-SIGN applies broadly to Federal and State statutes and regulations governing private sector (including business-to-business and business-to-consumer) activities. It generally covers legal requirements that information be disclosed in private transactions. It also requires that agencies generally permit private parties to retain records electronically. The government may establish appropriate performance standards for the accuracy, integrity, and accessibility of records retained electronically, to ensure compliance with applicable statutes and to guard against fraud.

Agency activities and requirements that involve information, but do not relate to business, commercial, or consumer transactions, are not within the scope of E-SIGN. Instead they are addressed by GPEA. Certain statutes and regulations involve both GPEA and E-SIGN, especially with respect to record retention requirements in agency regulations that relate to business, consumer, and commercial transactions. Additionally, GPEA and E-SIGN guidance builds on the requirements and scope of the Paperwork Reduction Act (PRA) of 1995. All transactions that involve Federal information collections covered under the PRA are also covered under GPEA and E-SIGN. Guidance on implementing the requirements of these Acts is referenced below.

### Open Data Principles and Guidance

The following is a non-exhaustive list of what constitutes open data. Each principle exists along a continuum of
openness. It should be used as a rubric by agencies to determine how "open" their open data is. The principles are completeness, primacy, timeliness, ease of physical and electronic access, machine readability, non-discrimination, use of commonly owned standards, licensing, permanence and usage costs.

*1. Completeness*

Datasets released by the government should be as complete as possible, reflecting the entirety of what is recorded about a particular subject. All raw information from a dataset should be released to the public, except to the extent necessary to comply with federal law regarding the release of personally identifiable information. Metadata that defines and explains the
raw data should be included as well, along with formulas and explanations for how derived data was calculated. Doing so will permit users to understand the scope of information available and examine each data item at the greatest possible level of detail.

*2. Primacy*

Datasets released by the government should be primary source data. This includes the original information collected by the government, details on how the data was collected and the original source documents recording the collection of the data. Public dissemination will allow users to verify that information was collected properly and recorded accurately.

*3. Timeliness*

Datasets released by the government should be available to the public in a timely fashion. Whenever feasible, information collected by the government should be released as quickly as it is gathered and collected. Priority should be given to data whose utility is time sensitive. Real-time information updates would maximize the utility the public can obtain from
this information.

*4. Ease of Physical and Electronic Access*

Datasets released by the government should as accessible as possible, with accessibility defined as the ease with which information can be obtained, whether through physical or electronic means. Barriers to physical access include requirements to visit a particular office in person or requirements to comply with particular procedures (such as completing forms or
submitting FOIA requests). Barriers to automated electronic access include making data accessible only via submitted forms or systems that require browser-oriented technologies (e.g., Flash, Javascript, cookies or Java applets). By contrast, providing an interface for users to download all of the information stored in a database at once (known as "bulk" access) and the means to make specific calls for data through an Application Programming Interface (API) make data much more readily accessible. (An aspect of this is "findability," which is the ability to easily locate and download content.)

*5. Machine readability*

Machines can handle certain kinds of inputs much better than others. For example, handwritten notes on paper are very difficult for machines to process. Scanning text via Optical Character Recognition (OCR) results in many matching and formatting errors. Information shared in the widely-used PDF format, for example, is very difficult for machines to parse. Thus, information should be stored in widely-used file formats that easily lend themselves to machine processing. (When other factors necessitate the use of difficult-to-parse formats, data should also be available in machine-friendly formats.) These files should be accompanied by documentation related to the format and how to use it in relation to the data.

*6. Non-discrimination*

"Non-discrimination" refers to who can access data and how they must do so. Barriers to use of data can include registration or membership requirements. Another barrier is the uses of "walled garden," which is when only some applications are allowed access to data. At its broadest, non-discriminatory access to data means that any person can access the data at any time without having to identify him/herself or provide any justification for doing so.

*7. Use of Commonly Owned Standards*

Commonly owned (or "open") standards refers to who owns the format in which data is stored. For example, if only one company manufactures the program that can read a file where data is stored, access to that information is dependent upon use of the company's processing program. Sometimes that program is unavailable to the public at any cost, or is available, but for a fee. For example, Microsoft Excel is a fairly commonly-used spreadsheet program which costs money to use. Freely available alternative formats often exist by which stored data can be accessed without the need for a software license. Removing this cost makes the data available to a wider pool of potential users.

*8. Licensing*

The imposition of "Terms of Service," attribution requirements, restrictions on dissemination and so on acts as barriers to public use of data. Maximal openness includes clearly labeling public information as a work of the government and available without restrictions on use as part of the public domain.

*9. Permanence*

The capability of finding information over time is referred to as permanence. Information released by the government online should be sticky: It should be available online in archives in perpetuity. Often times, information is updated, changed or removed without any indication that an alteration has been made. Or, it is made available as a stream of data, but not archived anywhere. For best use by the public, information made available online should remain online, with appropriate version-tracking and archiving over time.

*10. Usage Costs*

One of the greatest barriers to access to ostensibly publicly-available information is the cost imposed on the public for access--even when the cost is *de minimus*. Governments use a number of bases for charging the public for access to their own documents: the costs of creating the information; a cost-recovery basis (cost to produce the information divided by the expected number of purchasers); the cost to retrieve information; a per page or per inquiry cost; processing cost; the cost of duplication etc.

Most government information is collected for governmental purposes, and the existence of user fees has little to no effect on whether the government gathers the data in the first place. Imposing fees for access skews the pool of who is willing (or able) to access information. It also may preclude transformative uses of the data that in turn generates business
growth and tax revenues.
