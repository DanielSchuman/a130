## **Oversight**

1. Evaluation
The Director of OMB shall use information technology planning reviews, fiscal budget reviews, information collection budget reviews, management reviews, and such other measures as the Director deems necessary to evaluate the adequacy and efficiency of each agency's information resources management and compliance with this Circular.

2. Waivers
The Director of OMB may, consistent with statute and upon written request of an agency, grant a waiver from particular requirements of this Circular. Requests for waivers must detail the reasons why a particular waiver is sought, identify the duration of the waiver sought, and include a plan for the prompt and orderly transition to full compliance with the requirements of this Circular. Notice of each waiver request must be published promptly by the agency in the Federal Register, with a copy of the waiver request made available to the public on request.

3. Forms
The Director of OMB shall address agency practices that permit and often encourage agency use of paper-forms to gather and channel requests for information. OMB will convene an effort and issue directives to reform how agencies uses forms to ensure they are electronic and allow for the easy flow of data into databases. Among other things, this will ensure:
  a) Information will be validated upon input and automatically checked for errors. 
  b) To the maximum extent possible, unique entity identifiers will be utilized, particularly those that are consistent across databases. 
  c) Forced-choice mechanisms and limited data fields will be utilized to restrict the kinds of information that can be input. 
  d) Data willbe automatically segregated as to what is and is not disclosable, so that no further review is necessary for data tagged as disclosable. 

In addition, OMB will lead efforts to employ multiple techniques to improve the quality of information submitted. Extensive user testing (including A/B testing) will be performed and monitored on an ongoing basis to ensure forms are as easy to understand and complete as possible. Behavioral economics should be employed to maximize the effect of data collection, including through the development of model forms. Furthermore, to the extent possible, data will be pre-populated to reduce the amount of time required to enter information.

4. Public Records Review Group
The Director of OMB shall establish a  working group composed of government and non-governmental stakeholders to examine and make recommendations on the process by which public information that is not online shall be made available online. OMB shall consider those recommendations and implement regulations that address maximining onnline access to public non-online information.
